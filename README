Approximate number of sentences in the TR data (not just parallel, but all of what we have including just monolingual)  Accurate to with +/- 25%
Approximate number of LDC licensed sentences used by all of our models including back translation/monolingual data.  Again just a ballpark to within +/- 25%
Approximate number of sentences from WMT and IWSLT corpora across languages, again ballpark so don’t waste time on minute details.  Better to have numbers sooner with bigger error bars … it’s the logarithm of the size that matters. 

consider data potentially used in the future
