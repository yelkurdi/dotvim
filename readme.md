Approximate number of sentences in the TR data 
(not just parallel, but all of what we have including just monolingual)
Accurate to with +/- 25%

Approximate number of LDC licensed sentences used by all of our models including back translation/monolingual data.  
Again just a ballpark to within +/- 25%

Approximate number of sentences from WMT and IWSLT corpora across languages, again ballpark so don’t waste time on minute details.  
Better to have numbers sooner with bigger error bars … it’s the logarithm of the size that matters.
